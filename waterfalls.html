    <p>Hogenakkal falls are also known as 'Niagara of India'! Hogenakkal is a picnic spot in Dharmapuri district. This is also the place where river Cauvery (or Kavery) enters Tamil Nadu. One stream of this river forms the Hogenakkal falls which forms clouds of water droplets that look like white clouds! No doubt, Hogenakkal literally stands for smoking rock --- 'Hoge' means smoke and 'kal' means rock.
        There are large number of carbonatite rocks in this site. Hogenakkal is also referred to as Marikottayam by the local populace.
    <br>
    
The best part about this picnic spot is that you can enjoy boating during dry season. People also love to bathe under the falls as it is believed to contain healing properties. The reason for this is based on the fact that river Cauvery flows through a forest area replete with herbal trees and plants before reaching Hogenakkal. So, people come here to have bath in the river. They also enjoy strolling and trekking in this place.
<br>
The boats here are special as they are propelled and steered by a single paddle! Do you like to go fishing? Freshly caught fishes of varieties ranging from katla, keluthi, mirgal, jilaby etc. Today, the Hogenakkal water project is providing drinking water to different regions in Dharmapuri district and Krishnagiri district.
