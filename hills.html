    <p>Situated in the Servarayan or Shevaroy hill ranges of the Eastern Ghats, Yercaud is rightly termed the “jewel of the south”. It is in the Salem district of Tamil Nadu. Yercaud is located at an altitude of 1,515 metres above sea level and is a ravishingly beautiful hill station nestled within thick forested slopes, orange groves and coffee plantations. Picturesque and peaceful, it is a perfect vacation spot for all your family. The temperature is moderate, and stays between 13°C -29°C. The Yercaud Lake is the center of the town from which the town gets its name, since “Yeri” means lake in Tamil and “Kaadu” means forest.
